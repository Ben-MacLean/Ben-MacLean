Major: Aerospace Engineering 

About Me: I'm interested in all things engineering and believe that if we work together as a team/society then things can not only be done better but also more efficiently. This in the long run will only just benefit society more. Being wrong and failing is hard but the person who does this more often only just becomes better and more resilient. Be jealous of these people since they will someday have more experience than you and in turn more knowledge. Always keep striving to become better every day, then just imagine where you will be in 10 years!!
